Abstract:
With the evolution of autonomous vehicles in past decade, significant research and implementation has been achieved in
autonomous mobility industry. With focus on user experience improvement for drivers and pedestrians, Data safety has also been a
point of interest in recent research in autonomous vehicles due to interconnectedness of vehicles with each other and external infra-
structure. In this article, we review recent developments in the field of vehicle connectedness, user cases, benefits, security and safety
challenges, 6G solutions, and future research opportunities
